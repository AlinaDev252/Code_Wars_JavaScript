# Code Wars with JavaScript

-> Kata1

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.
If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]


-> Kata2

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

Ex.: [1,2,'aasf','1','123',123] == [1,2,123]


-> Kata3

Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

Ex.:
XO("ooxx") => true
XO("xooxx") => false
XO("ooxXm") => true
XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
XO("zzoo") => false
